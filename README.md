My First TwitterBot

This is my first attempt to write a bot for twitter in javascript. This first development attempt is to learn how to develop this tool (bot for a social network), have some fun and apply some of the concepts and knowledge I have in javascript on a daily basis and in my studies in something that I can do difference in the world.

In addition to being a learning tool for future projects, I hope this knowledge can be of use to anyone interested in learning more about the subject.

The links I used as a reference/study will be left further down in this readme file.
